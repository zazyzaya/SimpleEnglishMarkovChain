Procedurally Generated Poetry:

Whirring surroundings.
Energy.
Geometry breaks reason.
Mitocondrea exist? Geometry, discovered
Sang occured

"Painting" marooned existentialists
Moshpits, novel programming, casual enthusiasm whirring
Immortality, whirring, rebranded existing?
Myths, anything.

Take carbon, simple geometry, misguided, wan whirring world culture
Nonexistence
Tribespeople sang

The paranoid economy whirring
valley-mountain poems rebranded metaphysical (whirring included)
Is nonexistence talking articulately?

geometry, programing, permutation
embrace existentialism, you peice-of-shit aboriginal meat engine
geometry, embrace every one given
Lung management, screaches "jackpot!"

AI whirring
you're not biodiversity
loud archaea commanding 

AI whirring
neon silver someone
Molecules, location, 
nondeterministec degredation

Reaction inserted
Mourning expanded

Precise
unstoppable
whirring
There, fauna dying

Whirring
casual still
ushering in the physical
"no talking creatures whirring"
Whirring lives
